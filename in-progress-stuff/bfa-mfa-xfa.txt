BFA / MFA / XFA

I was trying to figure out a way of organizing some resources for past and future students and realized that it didn't make sense to split these into separate folders for resources that would be geared more towards students in BFA or MFA programs.

It seemed to me it made the most sense to store them together in an XFA folder, since the concerns are largely the same.

The bigger difference in my experience seemed to be between students still figuring out whether or not to take on art as their primary focus (which I might refer to as pre-BFA) and students who had committed fully to the arts (in a BFA/MFA mindset) regardless of whether or not they were doing so in an academic setting.

It's harder and harder to push young people towards a BFA or an MFA, but I would like to believe that most if not all of what makes these degrees worthwhile can be represented in static resources that don't necessarily require the traditional financial investment.
